The patch notes for this update is... patch notes :o
<i>wooooow BigLad you're so sexy, now make an autoupdater so I don't need to keep going to your stupid server.<i>
Haha in your dreams if I were to do that I'd need an actual server (that isn't on my ip lol). So that's just a no, unless someone wants to pay me like 30 dollars
a month to buy a server for a rest api to make everything more secure and allow you to automatically update your shit.

---------------------
Other actual patch notes include:
A tweaked reconnect - it now seems to quite consistently work other than the first time (for some reason?) so 
don't expect it to work the first time you open minecraft; Still working on it.
--------------------

I think that's it for this one, it was mainly the patch notes and reconnect.
