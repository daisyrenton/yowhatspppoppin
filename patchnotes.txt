Ok hey, no update here. Still read though!
Anyway, recently I've been working on a central database 
to keep track of all you cheeky fellas since I basically haven't done in the past.
Coming some point in the next few days, I reckon, will be a sort of purge where I will remove every account from the list
unless you message me your current usernames. When I ask for it, you have 24 hours to do this before the old list is replaced
by the new. Just a heads up nothing's happenening yet. Don't message me yet either, the database isn't ready yet.
I'll probably add a channel (no history ofc so private) on script central when the time comes for you to put the names there too.
