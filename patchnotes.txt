New Update! Get it now if you Haven't.

Hey, so just a random out of the blue update. Someone (was actually jacob) sparked an idea in my head about the
reconnect, so I decided to add it. He tested it and it seems to work far better - this should be the final update to the
reconnect. You should no longer arrive back to your pc with the bot stuck in limbo anymore; it was a problem with my disconnect detection
which just never worked essentially. It now will. I really hope. Fingers crossed.
This can also now be used with patcher as I removed the conflicting mod ID.
Thanks guys and please tell me if this does anything!
XOXO - your dad BigLad3511 Xx (I should be more professional, huh)
