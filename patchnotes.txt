New Update! Get it now if you Haven't.

alr so basically, someone suspected that the source of the bans was using menus and inventory whilst scripting.
This new update will instantly close any inventory as soon as it's opened in the code (so in most cases it won't even show on screen).
Even so I recommend just not pressing any menu buttons regardless, just in case.
You also can't use escape or chat just to be safe, but if people think those specific 2 aren't the root cause of the problem I can easily add them back in.
You can open the script's custom gui as I'm pretty sure the main problem is when opening skyblocks gui over the network.
Again, even so, try not to open this menu whilst scripting if possible, simply stop it for a second.
Better safe than sorry. Oh and the reason they had this conclusion is perfectly logical - 
it's a watchdog ban, as in, nothing to do with skyblock (based on the no wipe and ban message) which makes sense since it's 
just watchdog doing what watchdog does. 
Granted, it may be the looking or the movement but those have been
fine for a while and I see no reason for hypixel to have a problem with them. 

Oh also the purse thing was apparently showing 10x your actual purse so I divided it by 10,
and the title now says that accounts username again at the request of chadney

Thanks guys and please tell me if this does anything!
